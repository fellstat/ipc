\description{
Stops a future run in a multicore plan
}
\details{
This function sends terminate and kill signals to the process running the future,
and will only work for futures run on a multicore plan. This approach is not
recommended for cases where you can listen for interrupts within the future
(with \code{AsyncInterruptor}). However, for cases where long running code is
in an external library for which you don't have control, this can be the only way
to terminate the execution.

Note that multicore is not supported on Windows machines or within RStudio.
